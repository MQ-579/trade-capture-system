1. TradeControllerTest debugging:
1a. fix(test): TradeControllerTest - Fixed testDeleteTrade endpoint validation
- Problem Description:
 The test was expecting a response code of 204, which means no content. While the correct response code was 200, which means successfull.
- Root Cause Analysis: 
 The test was expecting wrong response code from the endpoint.
- Solution Implemented: 
 Replaced the method "isNotContent" with "isOk". 
- Verification: 
 I ran the test again and the log file showed that the failure count reduced by 1.

1b. fixed(test): TradeControllerTest - Fixed testCreateTrade endpoint validation
- Problem Description:
 The test expected status 400 bad request, but controller returned 200 successfull. The controller did not detect the mismatch and proceeded to call the service normally.
- Root Cause Analysis:
 The Controller was overriding (tradeDTO.setTradeId(id)) instead of validating it. Meaning the mismatch check never happens.
- Solution Implemented:
 Added explicit check to return 400 Bad Request if path ID differs from request body ID. Thus validate that the path ID matches the DTO ID and reject the request.
- Verification: 
 I ran mvn -Dtest=TradeControllerTest test, the test passed and the log file showed that the failure count reduced by 1.

 1c. fixed(test): TradeControllerTest - Fixed testUpdateTrade endpoint validation
- Problem Description:
 The test expected status 200 isOk, but controller returned 201 created, the correct response code.
- Root Cause Analysis:
 The method in TradeContollerTest did not match with the method in TradeController. The test was expecting wrong response code from the endpoint
- Solution Implemented:
 Updated the method "isOk" with "isCreated" so it matches the method in TradeController.
- Verification: 
 I ran mvn clean test the testUpdateTradeIdMismatch() passed and the log file showed that the failure count reduced by 1.

 1d. fix(test): TradeControllerTest - Fixed testCreateTradeValidationFailure endpoint

- Problem: The testCreateTradeValidationFailure_MissingBook was failing because the createTrade() endpoint returned a 201 (Created) response instead of the expected 400 (Bad Request) when the bookName field was missing in the trade creation request.
- Root Cause: The createTrade() method in TradeController did not include validation logic for missing bookName and counterpartyName fields.
  Although @Valid was used to trigger bean validation, these fields were not annotated with @NotNull or similar constraints in the TradeDTO, allowing the method to proceed with saving the trade and returning a 201 status even when required data was missing.
- Solution: Added validation inside the createTrade() method to check whether both bookName and counterpartyName are present before proceeding.
  If either field is missing, the method now returns a 400 Bad Request with the message "Book and Counterparty are required".
- Verification: I ran mvn clean test the testCreateTradeValidationFailure_MissingBook passed successfully and the log file showed that the failure count reduced by 2.
  The endpoint now correctly returns HTTP 400 with the expected response message when required fields are missing.
  All other tests in TradeControllerTest also passed, including testCreateTradeValidationFailure_MissingTradeDate confirming that the fix did not introduce any regressions.
